/* Gemini generated code:
This updated function now includes a try-catch block to handle the
InterruptedException that can occur when a thread is interrupted while
sleeping. Inside the catch block, you can add code to handle the
nterruption appropriately. In this example, we simply print a message
and re-interrupt the thread.
Remember that using Thread.sleep() is generally discouraged
in Android development. If you can provide more context about your
use case, I can suggest more suitable alternatives.
