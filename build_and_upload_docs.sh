# This script clones the current repo to a temp dir
# and then builds and uploads the documentation.
# The cloned repo is left in the build/ dir as I am allergic to
# unguarded "rm -rf" commands in scripts.   The documentation
# then lives in the github repo in the "gh-pages" branch.
# 
# The documentation on Github uses the awesome mkdocs + Material facility
# kindly provided by the awesome Martin Donath (squidfunk)
# FMI:
# https://www.mkdocs.org/
# https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/
#
#  script assumes you run this with the current dir in the "docs" folder
#  Note for windoze users : in gvim do a:
#    set ff=unix
#  to get the right line endings for unix.
